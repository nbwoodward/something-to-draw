      <h2>How to Start Drawing</h2>
      <p>
        To start drawing, you will need a few supplies such as paper, pencils,
        and erasers. You may also want to consider using other materials such as
        charcoal, pastels, or ink depending on the type of drawing you want to
        create. Before you start drawing, it can be helpful to have an idea in
        mind of what you want to draw. This can be a still life set up, a
        portrait of someone, or a landscape. Once you have your supplies and
        subject matter ready, start by lightly sketching out the basic shapes
        and forms of your subject. From there, you can add in details and refine
        your drawing. Remember to take breaks and step back from your drawing to
        get a fresh perspective. Don&apos;t be afraid to make mistakes, as they
        can often lead to unexpected and interesting results.
